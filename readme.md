This repository contains the automated tests I have made for my [personal JS30 portfolio](https://andreidbr.github.io/JS30/) .

It's powered by the terrific trio of Selenium, Java, and TestNG.

I'll soon start documenting the various challenges I encountered while automating the quality assurance tasks for my portfolio on Medium, so stay tuned for more insight into how I work.
